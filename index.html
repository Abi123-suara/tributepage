          <h2>ABHAS KUMAR GANGULY</h2>
          <p>
            <b>KISHORE KUMAR</b>  04 August 1929 â€“ 13 October 1987)
            was an Indian playback singer and actor.He is widely regarded as one of the greatest, most influential and dynamic singers in the history of Indian music.
            He was one of the most popular singers in the Indian subcontinent, notable for his yodeling and ability to sing songs in different voices.
            He used to sing in different genres but some of his rare compositions, considered classics, were lost in time.
            According to his brother and legendary actor Ashok Kumar, Kishore Kumar was so successful as a singer because his "voice hits the mike, 
            straight, at its most sensitive point.
          </p>

          <br>
          <p>Kishore Kumar was born in a Bengali Brahmin Ganguly family in Khandwa, Central Provinces (now in Madhya Pradesh) as Abhas Kumar Ganguly.
            His father, Kunjalal Ganguly (Gangopadhyay) was a lawyer and his mother, Gouri Devi came from a wealthy Bengali family and was a home-maker. 
            Kunjalal Gangopadhyaya was invited by the Kamavisadar Gokhale family of Khandwa to be their personal lawyer. 
            Kumar was the youngest of four siblings, the older three being Ashok (the eldest), Sati Devi, and Anoop.
            While Kumar was still a child, his brother Ashok became an actor in Hindi cinema. 
            Later, Anoop also ventured into cinema with Ashok's help.Kumar graduated from Christian College, Indore.</p>
            <br>

            <p>Kumar's first film appearance was in Shikari (1946), in which his brother, Ashok played the lead role. 
              Kumar played the lead in the Bombay Talkies film Andolan (1951), directed by Phani Majumdar. 
              Although he got some acting assignments with the help of his brother, he was more interested in becoming a singer. 
              But Ashok wanted Kumar to be an actor like him.Between 1946 and 1955, Kumar appeared in 22 films of which 16 were flops and since he was 
              disinterested in taking up acting as a career, he would find ways to be in the bad books of the director or producer, 
              so that they throw him from their films. It was only after the success of films such as Ladki, Naukari, Miss Malaysia, Char Paise 
              and Baap Re Baap that Kumar developed an interest in acting seriously, which resulted in him having successful films as the lead
               actor between 1955 and 1966.Kumar starred in Bimal Roy's Naukari (1954) and Hrishikesh Mukherjee's directorial debut Musafir (1957). 
               Salil Chowdhury, the music director for Naukari, was initially dismissive of Kumar as a singer when he found that Kumar had no formal 
               training in music.However, after hearing his voice, Chowdhury gave him the song Chhota Sa Ghar Hoga, which was supposed to be sung by
                Hemant Kumar.The commercially successful films of Kumar included Ladki (1953), Naukari (1954), Baap Re Baap (1955), 
                Paisa Hi Paisa (1956), New Delhi (1956), Naya Andaz (1956), Bhagam Bhaag (1956), Bhai Bhai (1956), Aasha (1957), Chalti Ka Naam Gaadi (1958),
                 Dilli Ka Thug (1958), Jaalsaaz (1959), Bombay Ka Chor (1962), Chacha Zindabad (1959), Man-Mauji (1962), Jhumroo (1961), Half Ticket (1962), 
                 Mr. X in Bombay (1964), Shreeman Funtoosh (1965), Ek Raaz (1963), Ganga Ki Lahren (1964), Hum Sab Ustaad Hai (1965), Haal E Dil, 
                 Pyar Kiye Jaa (1966), and Padosan (1968). As an actor, his best period was between 1954 and 1966. His onscreen pairing with actresses Mala Sinha,
                  Vyjayanthimala, Nutan, Madhubala, Meena Kumari and Kumkum gave the biggest hits in his career. Chalti Ka Naam Gaadi (1958), his home production,
                   had the three Ganguly brothers and Madhubala in main roles. Kumar played a car mechanic who has a romance with a city girl; 
                   (Madhubala) with a subplot involving the brothers.Kumar acted in and composed the music for Jhumroo (1961), and wrote the lyrics 
                   for the film's title song, "Main Hoon Jhumroo". Later, he produced and directed Door Gagan Ki Chhaon Mein (1964), where he starred 
                   with Bengali actress Supriya Devi.He also wrote the script and composed music for the film, which is about the relationship between a
                    father (Kumar) and his deaf and mute son (played by his real-life son Amit Kumar).</p>
